        <h3>What Does Morality Mean to Me?</h3>
        <p>Morality to me is how we determine a good person from a bad person. In my eyes, one of the biggest confusions
            with morality is between morality and the law. Many people think that people that are breaking the law are
            immoral, and as easy as it is to define people who break the law as immoral people, there is much more to
            the picture! One way to easily see that morality and legality are two different topics entirely is in the
            thought experiment: would you steal food to feed for your starving family. Knowing someone's morals is
            knowing if they are a good or bad person, and if you can trust them.

            <h6>right</h6>
            <p class="right-copy"> I believe that in the classic bread example, stealing to feed your family would be
                acceptable if you knew that the store owner would survive the loss.
                <br>
                (so its not ok if you know you are stealing from someone who needs the money) <br>
                Additionally good intentions make your actions morally acceptable, but not all good actions are morally
                acceptable.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrong">
            <h6>wrong</h6>
            <p class="wrong-copy">Doing something considered “good” for personal gain or for other poor intentions, is
                immoral. <br>
                For example, building a homeless shelter simply to get into a good college! <br>
                I believe strongly that intentions are IMPORTANT!

            <h3>Our Ego</h3>
            <p>We constantly will believe that WE are the most morally correct, and that other people are immoral,
                simply due to our ego! Additionally we can let out ego “get in the way” and cloud our judgement! In
                fact, too much ego can lead to a large number of immoral actions!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ignorance">
            <h3>Our Ignorance</h3>
            <p>Ignorance can play a large part in us taking immoral actions before we know the whole story, or even
                care to know the whole story. If we are ignorant about the fact that the seller of the bread in the
                store is just as hungry and starving as our family is...then stealing would be immoral weather or not we
                were ignorant and knew about this!</p>
